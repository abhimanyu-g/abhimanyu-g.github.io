#+description: About Abhimanyu G - Embedded Linux Engineer, Kernel Developer, ARM Expert


I'm a systems engineer and Linux enthusiast passionate about building deeply technical solutions at the intersection of hardware and software. With a strong focus on embedded Linux, kernel development, and ARM architecture, I help companies design performant, low-level systems that scale.

I'm currently diving deep into the Linux kernel and real-time systems, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing what I learn along the way. Whether it's writing drivers, debugging obscure bugs, or optimizing build systems, I love solving hard problems that touch silicon.
