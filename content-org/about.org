#+DESCRIPTION: About Abhimanyu G - Embedded Linux Engineer, Kernel Developer, ARM Expert

* 💻 Work
I'm a systems engineer and Linux enthusiast with about a /decade/ (10 years) of experience. My passion lies in building deeply technical solutions at the intersection of hardware and software. With a strong focus on embedded Linux, kernel development, and ARM architecture, I help companies design performant, low-level systems that scale.

I'm currently diving deep into the Linux kernel and real-time systems, tinkering with Emacs and sharing what I learn along the way. Whether it's writing drivers, debugging obscure bugs, or optimizing build systems, I love solving hard problems that touch silicon.
