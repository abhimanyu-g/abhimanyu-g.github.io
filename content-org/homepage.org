In software, a [[https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton][singleton]] is a design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists, a solitary presence with a purpose.

In life, we are each our own singleton — uniquely instantiated, deeply stateful, shaped by memory and experience.

=Singletonlife= is a meditation on this singular existence: one developer navigating many dimensions /embedded systems, calisthenics, music and Emacs/ all within a single coherent process. No duplication, no forking, just one instance, dynamically evolving, yet always whole.

To live the Singletonlife is to embrace solitude not as isolation, but as integrity. A life compiled with curiosity, linked with intention, and executed with awareness.
