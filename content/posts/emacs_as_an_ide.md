What makes a good Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?

Well, it depends on a specific developer, language, workspace and its restrictions so on.. In short, there is no one answer to the above question. However, there are few salient features that is objectively constant, something that all developers appreciate, A _bare minimum_ if you will.

Here are the common features that make an IDE good IMO

-   Spell checker
-   Syntax highlighting
-   Linter
-   Support Language server
-   Compilation
-   Debugger

Throughout this blog, I will try to describe the above features and how to get a reasonable working setup with Emacs for each of this features.

{{< alert icon="circle-info" >}}
Before we begin, I am a embedded software engineer by profession who primarily works on `C/C++` code. My setup is aimed at working with aforementioned languages. But with few tweaks, it can be ported to any language. My goal here is to provide enough resources to get started

## Spell checker {#spell-checker}

![](/images/spelling-mistake-meme.jpg)
Fixing a spelling is one of the most trivial feature of a good text editor let alone an IDE. In Emacs, there is a built-in package called `flyspell`. It is a client of sorts that runs [gnu aspell](http://aspell.net/) application under-the-hood to provide spelling suggestions. The configuration might look something like below

```emacs-lisp
;; Spell check. Requires 'aspell' under-the-hood
(use-package flyspell
  :ensure nil ;;Inbuilt package
  :hook (text-mode . flyspell-mode)
  :config
  (flyspell-mode 1))
```

I enable `flyspell` using _use-package_ and hook it into all the `text-mode` files (org files, program source files, etc...). In the end I enable _flyspell-mode_ to be globally enabled
The way it works is,

-   When there is a spelling mistake, the Editor underlines it with red squiggly line
-   You press <kbd>Meta + $</kbd> on the squiggly lines to pull-up the recommendations for the misspelled word
-   You press the keys associated with each suggested word and it replaces the misspelled word.

Here's how it looks

## Syntax highlighting {#syntax-highlighting}

Syntax highlighting refers to coloring text that uniquely represents a type/class.
For reference, notice how the data types like _char, int_ are in `purple`, the language keywords like _for, if, return_ are in `teal` and so-on.

<a id="figure--Syntax-highlighting"></a>

{{< figure src="/images/syntax-highlighting.png" >}}

Historically, this was done with the help of language parsers. Each language would have a syntax parser that would break the code into a know regexp pattern and serve to the the IDE to then be highlighted. Although good, there are some notable issues with this approach and it is very rigid.

A more recent approach exists known as [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). It incrementally builds the language nuances into a syntax tree and is very robust IMO.

To use it with Emacs, we need to enable a _tree-sitter mode_. This is typically a well known major mode with `-ts-` in its name. For example,

| Legacy mode | Treesit equivalent | Comment                                   |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| c-mode      | c-ts-mode          | Major mode for editing 'C' source files   |
| c++-mode    | c++-ts-mode        | Major mode for editing 'C++' source files |

The configuration looks something like this

```emacs-lisp

;; Regexp magic. Auto mode for *.c and *.h files
(use-package c-ts-mode
  :ensure nil ;;inbuilt package
  :mode("\\.[ch]\\'" . c-ts-mode))

;; Regexp magic. Auto mode for *.cpp and *.hpp2 files
(use-package c++-ts-mode
  :ensure nil ;;inbuilt package
  :mode("\\.[ch]pp\\'" . c++-ts-mode))
```


### Installing language grammar {#installing-language-grammar}

After the above configuration, when you try to load a c/cpp source file. You would be presented by a message that might look like this

> ‚õî Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for cpp is unavailable (not-found): _.config/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-cpp: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory /_.config/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-cpp.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory _/.config/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-cpp.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory /_.config/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-cpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory _/.config/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-cpp.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory /_.config/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-cpp.so.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory libtree-sitter-cpp: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory libtree-sitter-cpp.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory libtree-sitter-cpp.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory libtree-sitter-cpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory libtree-sitter-cpp.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory libtree-sitter-cpp.so.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This basically means

> Although you have enabled the "ts" mode, you have not installed the appropriate language grammar for this type of file

To fix this, <kbd>M-x treesit-install-language-grammar</kbd> and follow the installation. To ease in the installation, you can pre-configure the language-grammar source paths and their compatible versions as shown below.

```emacs-lisp
(use-package treesit
    :ensure nil ;;Inbuilt package
    :config
    (setq treesit-language-source-alist
        '((c . ("https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c" "v0.24.1"))
            (cpp . ("https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp" "v0.23.4")))))
```


## Linter {#linter}

Take a look at the code below

```C
int x = 5;   // ‚úÖ valid syntax
int x 5 = ;  // ‚ùå invalid syntax
```

Intuitively, we know that the first statement is the correct syntax and the second statement is incorrect. The IDE does this with the help of a _syntax-checker_. Emacs ships with `flymake` syntax checker by default. There is another popular alternative called `flycheck`. Here's the installation

```emacs-lisp
;; On the fly syntax and linting check for all text mode. Faster than flymake + Better functionality
(use-package flycheck
  :ensure t
  :hook (prog-mode . flycheck-mode))
```

We install `flycheck` and hook it into all the prog-mode (which is a major parent mode for all programming languages)


## Language server {#language-server}

Traditionally, IDEs used to ship with a dedicated build utilities. However, with ever-evolving programming languages, their standards and new programming languages added in, it does not make sense to add new IDEs for every programming language out there!

To abstract IDEs from build infra, Microsoft created [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol). It is a standard that most of the new IDEs comply to.
The way this works is,

-   There is a language server based on the language you are editing running in the background
-   Every movement, edit etc are sent to these servers over _LSP_ and the IDE receives back a response on how to interpret the user-action
-   The IDE in-turn notifies the user (variable does not exist, No such file found, did you mean this? etc...)

Emacs conveniently abstracts the language server interaction such that the way you interact with every language server (c, cpp, python etc..) is the same.
Emacs provides a LSP client called [Eglot](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eglot.html) that ships with newer Emacs by default. We summon this client as below

```emacs-lisp
(defun custom/elgot-post-attach-hook ()
    (eglot-inlay-hints-mode -1)
    (local-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'eglot-prefix-map)
    (define-key eglot-prefix-map (kbd "fb") #'eglot-format-buffer)
    (define-key eglot-prefix-map (kbd "fr") #'eglot-format)
    (define-key eglot-prefix-map (kbd "r") #'eglot-rename)
    (define-key eglot-prefix-map (kbd "q") #'eglot-code-action-quickfix))

  (use-package eglot
    :ensure nil ;;Internal package
    :hook ((eglot-managed-mode . custom/elgot-post-attach-hook))
    :config
    (define-prefix-command 'eglot-prefix-map)
    (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               '((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode) . ("/usr/bin/clangd"))))
```

We configure the `Eglot` by sharing it the _mode_ vs _program_ configuration. This tells eglot what to run when enabled in a specific mode. But, this does not auto launch!

Also, there are bunch of keyboard shortcuts that ease up frequently used commands.

To auto launch an eglot instance, we need to update the configuration for each supported program mode. This way, when one of the below major-mode is activated, the buffer would be managed by Eglot. I.e Eglot manages and communicates the changes to-and-from a LSP server. **How cool is that!!**

```emacs-lisp
(use-package c-ts-mode
    :mode("\\.[ch]\\'" . c-ts-mode)
    :hook ((c-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)))

(use-package c++-ts-mode
  :mode("\\.[ch]pp\\'" . c++-ts-mode)
  :hook ((c++-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)))
```

Additionally, to begin unleashing complete potential of elgot, you need a **compilation database** which is essentially a `compile_commands.json` file that records all the project dependencies and presents it to Eglot. To generate such a database based on your build system (CMAKE, make, waf...) checkout [here](https://sarcasm.github.io/notes/dev/compilation-database.html#id26)


## Compilation {#compilation}

Any good language needs compilation üòâ (python folks assemble!)

If your project is _version controlled_ using for example **git**, then you are in luck. Emacs ships with a package called `project.el` that does all things project-management.

<kbd>Ctrl-x + p</kbd> is your entry-point for all things project-management. Notice that <kbd>Ctrl-x + pc</kbd> will run `project-compile` at the root of the project. This is very handy for multiple compilations (both repetitive and debug/release builds).

The variable `compile-command` dictates the compilation command to run when `project-compile` is evaluated. You can either configure it in your configuration `init.el` file or a better approach is to have a `.dir-locals-el` file per-project at project's root and add the below line.

```text
((nil .
      ((compile-command . "./build.sh"))))
```

This runs `build.sh` on every compilation. You can script your own build commands to build your project. Here is an example for one of my projects

```shell
# !/bin/bash

if [ ! -d build ]; then
    mkdir build
fi

cmake -S . -B build
make -C build
```

The directory looks like this

## Debugging {#debugging}

![](/images/debugging-meme.jpg)
Bugs are inevitable as the code grows. To enable quicker debugging, a good IDE provides ways to debug your code with _breakpoints_, _watchpoints_, _stack trace_ etc.. to give you a good idea of what's happening at the moment of failure.

Emacs ships with `gdb` and `gud-gdb`. I prefer the latter. Currently, I use it as-is without any configuration and seems to be working quite well for me. For the curious and tinkers among you gnu documentation on [emacs gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/GDB-Graphical-Interface.html) is a great starting point

Its worth mentioning [dape.el](https://github.com/svaante/dape) and [dap-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode). Both of which leverage the modern [Debug adapter protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) to have debug equivalent of LSP


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

My development needs are ever-evolving. I have just started to scratch the surface of what is possible. At the moment, the setups/configs mentioned above seems to get the job done. I always keep tinkering with my setup and this might evolve in the near future.

As always, it was a blast to be able to configure and summon the beast üòÅ
