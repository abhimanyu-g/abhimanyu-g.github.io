In software, a [singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) is a design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists — a solitary presence with a purpose.

In life, we are each our own singleton — uniquely instantiated, deeply stateful, shaped by memory and experience.

Singletonlife is a meditation on this singular existence: one developer navigating many dimensions — embedded systems, calisthenics, music, Emacs, and meaning — all within a single coherent process.

No duplication, no forking — just one instance, dynamically evolving, yet always whole.

> To live the Singletonlife is to embrace solitude not as isolation, but as integrity. A life compiled with curiosity, linked with intention, and executed with awareness.
